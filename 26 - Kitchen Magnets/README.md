Importance of building something with what you've learned, rather than relying on the assumption that you fully understood the lesson. For example, when I set out to build this project, I thought I was basing it off lessons learned in the JS30 Click and Drag exercise. While the outcomes are similar: clicking and dragging to change the location of a DOM element, the actual mechanisms behind them are different. (Scrolling within an element that exceeds the bounds of the page vs. changing the location of a selected element.)

This project ended up resembling most closely JS30 lesson 26, where we programmatically changed the location of the dropdown to contain whichever tab was selected.
